Avocado Price Models and Predictions

Avocados taste so good, but they're just so pricey! What is someone to do? Ignore their diminishing investment contributions at the expense of their morning avocado toast? Kick their haas habit? Or would it be wisest to uproot their lives and move to the city in the country with the cheapest avocado prices? Using 3 years of historical avocado sales data provided generously by the Haas Avocado Board, we'll set out to predict avocado prices across the country. This way, we'll determine which city (or cities) will be the best to move to for the guacamole that'll hurt our wallet the least.

In this repo, you'll find the following:

    - A Python notebook used for exploring and modeling the data, called `Avocado Price Predictions.ipynb`
    - The original avocado dataset, called `avocado.csv`
    - The cleaned and feature engineered avocado dataset used for modeling, called                 `cleaned_and_feature_engineered_avocados.csv`
